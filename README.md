# Class :- CPME 255 - Section 1, Data Mining
* This project is a part of the data mining subject at San Jose State University, serving as a semester project aimed at applying theoretical knowledge to practical data analysis scenarios.

## Project Option 1 : Data Modelling
>We chose the data modelling option as our term project for this class. We developed a software application which can detect the aestheosceloric plaque using computer vision


# Aestheosceloric Plaque Segmentation Using Computer Vision
